_Hint_: use **incremental** steps to bring your ideas to life.

<div class="aspect-square w-full border-2 border-black dark:border-white">
  <canvas class="absolute" id="canvas"></canvas>
</div>

<form id="form">
  <div class="mb-4 mt-4 flex w-full">
    <input
      type="text"
      id="text-input"
      class="mr-4 flex-1 p-2 pl-3 pr-3 text-xl"
    />
    <input type="submit" value="OK" class="pl-3 pr-3" />
  </div>
</form>

<textarea
  disabled
  id="log-area"
  rows="10"
  class="bg-stone w-full rounded-md border border-stone-500 text-sm dark:bg-stone-800"
/>

1. Enter an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). It will only
   be used by this page to call the OpenAI API.

2. Enter instructions for the drawing assistant. Results are generally better by
   adding instructions in several steps. Example:

   - _Fill a small section towards the bottom with a dark green color_

     _Assistant working..._

   - _Add a red house with a black roof standing on the ground_

     _..._

   While the assistant is working the canvas operations are printed in the log area.

3. Have fun!

Defining assistant [function

subset of the [Web Canvas

Mapping of tool calls to the actual canvas context methods/properties.
